# Tree Data Structure

This project implements a generic tree data structure in Java. The tree can be used to represent hierarchical structures such as organizational charts, file systems, and more. The implementation supports basic tree operations like adding children, finding a node, and traversing the tree in different orders.

## Introduction
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with each node containing a value and a list of children nodes. Trees are commonly used to represent data that has a hierarchical relationship, such as folders in a file system, organizational structures, or decision trees.

This project provides an easy-to-use and flexible implementation of a tree in Java, supporting various tree operations and traversal methods.

## Features
- **Generic Node**: The tree nodes can hold any data type.
- **Add Child**: You can add child nodes to any existing node.
- **Node Searching**: Allows searching for a node within the tree.
- **Traversals**: Supports pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.
- **Tree Representation**: The tree can be printed in a readable format.
